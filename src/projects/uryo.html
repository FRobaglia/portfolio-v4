          Uryō was an UX/UI group project for HETIC.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a team of 4, we had four days to think and design a unique product/brand
          from scratch. We decided to create Uryō, a brand proposing raincoats
          that change colors when getting wet. We had to design the homepage, and the customization page.
        </p>

          <figcaption>Custimization page of Uryō</figcaption>
          </figure>
        <p>
          As the lead developer, I was in charge of integrating the homepage of
          Uryō, to show a ‘proof of concept’ during our presentation.
        </p>
        <p>We also decided to design the homepage using traditional chinese characters, because the brand was mainly destinated to an asian audience. It was an interesting challenge because the chinese language is written in vertical, from up to down and right to left.</p>

        <p>
          This team project taught me a lot about UX and UI design, which I
          think are essential in order to get into front-end development.
