    <p>FatFinger is a personal project I like to work on during my free time.
      This is a website aiming to train keyboard typing skills, you have to type
       as much words as possible within 30 seconds. 
    </p>
    <p>When I first had the idea, I coded it in Vanilla JavaScript, but after learning React I decided to clean all the code and use React to improve my React knowledge</p>
