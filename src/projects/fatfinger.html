    <p>FatFinger is a personal project I like to work on during my free time.
      This is a website aiming to train the user keyboard skills. The user has to type as much words as possible within 30 seconds.
      
    </p>
    <p>FatFinger was my first ‘big’ personal project and I learned a lot working on it. I also had to think the design, and the UX/UI.</p>

    <p>It was first coded in vanilla JavaScript, but when I learnt React I decided to clean all the code to rewrite it using React, both to train myself and improve both the readability of the code and the game’s performance.
    </p>
    <p>The website is fully responsive, accessible and fast to load.</p>
